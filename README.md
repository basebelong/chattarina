# chattarina

Just a slightly modified terminal chat (from official docs examples).

## Installation

  1. Clone the repo anywhere.
  2. Run `chattarina --install` and enter your API key when prompted.

The install script assumes you are fine with having chattarina installed to ~/.local/opt/chattarina and having the run-install-update wrapper script in ~/.local/bin

## Usage

Simply run `chattarina` and enjoy the chat experience. She is set to be somewhat flirty. Because, reasons.

## Update

`chattarina --update`
